    public final class EDecimal extends Object implements Comparable<EDecimal>

<p>Represents an arbitrary-precision decimal floating-point number. (The "E"
 stands for "extended", meaning that instances of this class can be values
 other than numbers proper, such as infinity and not-a-number.)
 </p><p><b>About decimal arithmetic</b> </p> <p>Decimal (base-10) arithmetic,
 such as that provided by this class, is appropriate for calculations
 involving such real-world data as prices and other sums of money, tax rates,
 and measurements. These calculations often involve multiplying or dividing
 one decimal with another decimal, or performing other operations on decimal
 numbers. Many of these calculations also rely on rounding behavior in which
 the result after rounding is an arbitrary-precision decimal number (for
 example, multiplying a price by a premium rate, then rounding, should result
 in a decimal amount of money).</p> <p>On the other hand, most
 implementations of <code>float</code> and <code>double</code> , including in C# and
 Java, store numbers in a binary (base-2) floating-point format and use
 binary floating-point arithmetic. Many decimal numbers can't be represented
 exactly in binary floating-point format (regardless of its length). Applying
 binary arithmetic to numbers intended to be decimals can sometimes lead to
 unintuitive results, as is shown in the description for the FromDouble()
 method of this class.</p> <p><b>About EDecimal instances</b> </p> <p>Each
 instance of this class consists of an integer significand and an integer
 exponent, both arbitrary-precision. The value of the number equals
 significand * 10^exponent.</p> <p>The significand is the value of the digits
 that make up a number, ignoring the decimal point and exponent. For example,
 in the number 2356.78, the significand is 235678. The exponent is where the
 "floating" decimal point of the number is located. A positive exponent means
 "move it to the right", and a negative exponent means "move it to the left."
 In the example 2, 356.78, the exponent is -2, since it has 2 decimal places
 and the decimal point is "moved to the left by 2." Therefore, in the
 arbitrary-precision decimal representation, this number would be stored as
 235678 * 10^-2.</p> <p>The significand and exponent format preserves
 trailing zeros in the number's value. This may give rise to multiple ways to
 store the same value. For example, 1.00 and 1 would be stored differently,
 even though they have the same value. In the first case, 100 * 10^-2 (100
 with decimal point moved left by 2), and in the second case, 1 * 10^0 (1
 with decimal point moved 0).</p> <p>This class also supports values for
 negative zero, not-a-number (NaN) values, and infinity. <b>Negative zero</b>
 is generally used when a negative number is rounded to 0; it has the same
 mathematical value as positive zero. <b>Infinity</b> is generally used when
 a non-zero number is divided by zero, or when a very high or very low number
 can't be represented in a given exponent range. <b>Not-a-number</b> is
 generally used to signal errors.</p> <p>This class implements the General
 Decimal Arithmetic Specification version 1.70 except part of chapter 6(
 <code>http://speleotrove.com/decimal/decarith.html</code>).</p> <p><b>Errors and
 Exceptions</b> </p> <p>Passing a signaling NaN to any arithmetic operation
 shown here will signal the flag FlagInvalid and return a quiet NaN, even if
 another operand to that operation is a quiet NaN, unless the operation's
 documentation expressly states that another result happens when a signaling
 NaN is passed to that operation.</p> <p>Passing a quiet NaN to any
 arithmetic operation shown here will return a quiet NaN, unless the
 operation's documentation expressly states that another result happens when
 a quiet NaN is passed to that operation. Invalid operations will also return
 a quiet NaN, as stated in the individual methods.</p> <p>Unless noted
 otherwise, passing a null arbitrary-precision decimal argument to any method
 here will throw an exception.</p> <p>When an arithmetic operation signals
 the flag FlagInvalid, FlagOverflow, or FlagDivideByZero, it will not throw
 an exception too, unless the flag's trap is enabled in the arithmetic
 context (see EContext's Traps property).</p> <p>If an operation requires
 creating an intermediate value that might be too big to fit in memory (or
 might require more than 2 gigabytes of memory to store -- due to the current
 use of a 32-bit integer internally as a length), the operation may signal an
 invalid-operation flag and return not-a-number (NaN). In certain rare cases,
 the compareTo method may throw OutOfMemoryError (called OutOfMemoryError in
 Java) in the same circumstances.</p> <p><b>Serialization</b> </p> <p>An
 arbitrary-precision decimal value can be serialized (converted to a stable
 format) in one of the following ways:</p> <ul><li>By calling the toString()
 method, which will always return distinct strings for distinct
 arbitrary-precision decimal values.</li><li>By calling the UnsignedMantissa,
 Exponent, and IsNegative properties, and calling the IsInfinity, IsQuietNaN,
 and IsSignalingNaN methods. The return values combined will uniquely
 identify a particular arbitrary-precision decimal value.</li></ul>
 <p><b>Thread safety</b> </p> <p>Instances of this class are immutable, so
 they are inherently safe for use by multiple threads. Multiple instances of
 this object with the same properties are interchangeable, so they should not
 be compared using the "==" operator (which might only check if each side of
 the operator is the same instance).</p> <p><b>Comparison considerations</b>
 </p> <p>This class's natural ordering (under the compareTo method) is not
 consistent with the Equals method. This means that two values that compare
 as equal under the compareTo method might not be equal under the Equals
 method. The compareTo method compares the mathematical values of the two
 instances passed to it (and considers two different NaN values as equal),
 while two instances with the same mathematical value, but different
 exponents, will be considered unequal under the Equals method.</p>
 <p><b>Security note</b> </p> <p>It is not recommended to implement
 security-sensitive algorithms using the methods in this class, for several
 reasons:</p> <ul><li><code>EDecimal</code> objects are immutable, so they can't
 be modified, and the memory they occupy is not guaranteed to be cleared in a
 timely fashion due to garbage collection. This is relevant for applications
 that use many-digit-long numbers as secret parameters.</li><li>The methods
 in this class (especially those that involve arithmetic) are not guaranteed
 to be "constant-time" (non-data-dependent) for all relevant inputs. Certain
 attacks that involve encrypted communications have exploited the timing and
 other aspects of such communications to derive keying material or cleartext
 indirectly.</li></ul> <p>Applications should instead use dedicated security
 libraries to handle big numbers in security-sensitive algorithms.</p>
 <p><b>Reproducibility note</b> </p> <p>Some applications, such as
 simulations, care about results that are reproducible, bit for bit, across
 computers and across runs of the application. Bruce Dawson, in
 "Floating-Point Determinism" (<code>https://randomascii.wordpress.com/</code>
 <code>2013/07/16/floating-point-determinism/</code>), identified many
 reproducibility issues with floating-point numbers, and here is how they
 relate to the EDecimal and EFloat classes of this library:</p>
 <ul><li>Runtime floating-point settings: All the settings that change how
 EDecimal and EFloat behave are given as parameters to the appropriate
 methods, especially via EContext objects, which specify the precision,
 rounding, and exponent range of numbers, among other things. The EDecimal
 and EFloat classes avoid the use of "native" floating-point data types
 (except for methods that convert to or from <code>float</code> , <code>double</code> ,
 or <code>System.Decimal</code>). Such "native" types are often subject to
 runtime settings that change how floating-point math behaves with them, and
 these settings are often not accessible to .NET or Java
 code.</li><li>Non-associativity and intermediate precisions: In general,
 EDecimal and EFloat use "unlimited" precision in their calculations unless
 specified otherwise by an EContext object. However, by limiting the
 precision of EDecimal, EFloat, and other floating-point numbers in this way,
 operations such as addition and multiplication on three or more numbers can
 be <i>non-associative</i> , meaning the result can change depending on the
 order in which those numbers are added or multiplied. This property means
 that if an algorithm does not ensure such numbers are added or multiplied in
 the same order every time, its results may not be reproducible across
 computers or across runs of the application. This non-associativity problem
 can happen, for example, if an application splits a calculation across
 several threads and combines their results in the end. The problems with an
 unspecified order of operations (in the same line of code) and intermediate
 precisions (problems present in C and C++, for example) don't exist with
 method calls to EDecimal and EFloat methods, especially since they require
 limited-precision support to be declared explicitly via
 EContext.</li><li>fmadd instruction: EDecimal and EFloat include a
 MultiplyAndAdd method with the same semantics as in the General Decimal
 Arithmetic Specification, which requires delivering correctly rounded
 results for this method.</li><li>Square root estimate: Not applicable since
 EDecimal and EFloat don't include any estimates to square
 root.</li><li>Transcendental functions: This includes logarithms,
 exponentials, and the Pi method. For these functions, results are not
 guaranteed to always be correctly rounded. When using transcendentals, an
 application that cares about reproducibility should choose one version of
 this library and stick to it; this at least has the advantage that the
 implementation will be the same across computers, unlike with "native"
 floating-point types where the choice of implementation is often not within
 the application's control.</li><li>Conversions: Conversions between EDecimal
 or EFloat and text strings have the same implementation across computers for
 the same version of this library (see also the advice for transcendentals
 above). But as for the ToDouble, ToSingle, FromDouble, and FromSingle
 methods, note that some implementations of Java and.NET may or may not
 support preserving the value of subnormal numbers (numbers other than zero
 with the lowest possible exponent) or the payloads held in a not-a-number
 (NaN) value of float or double; thus these methods should not be considered
 reproducible across computers.</li><li>Compiler differences: Not applicable
 where these classes don't use "native" floating-point
 types.</li><li>Uninitialized data; per-processor code: Not
 applicable.</li></ul> <p><b>Forms of numbers</b> </p> <p>There are several
 other types of numbers that are mentioned in this class and elsewhere in
 this documentation. For reference, they are specified here.</p>

### FromDouble
    public static EDecimal FromDouble(double dbl)
<p>Creates an arbitrary-precision decimal number from a 64-bit binary
 floating-point number. This method computes the exact value of the floating
 point number, not an approximation, as is often the case by converting the
 floating point number to a string first. Remember, though, that the exact
 value of a 64-bit binary floating-point number is not always the value that
 results when passing a literal decimal number (for example, calling <code>
 EDecimal.FromDouble(0.1)</code>), since not all decimal numbers can be converted
 to exact binary numbers (in the example given, the resulting
 arbitrary-precision decimal will be the value of the closest "double" to
 0.1, not 0.1 exactly). To create an arbitrary-precision decimal number from
 a decimal value, use FromString instead in most cases (for example: <code>
 EDecimal.FromString("0.1")</code>). </p> <p>The input value can be a not-a-number
 (NaN) value (such as <code>Double.NaN</code>); however, NaN values have multiple
 forms that are equivalent for many applications' purposes, and <code>
 Double.NaN</code> is only one of these equivalent forms. In fact, <code>
 EDecimal.FromDouble(Double.NaN)</code> could produce an object that is represented
 differently between DotNet and Java, because <code>Double.NaN</code> may have a
 different form in DotNet and Java (for example, the NaN value's sign may be
 negative in DotNet, but positive in Java). Use `IsNaN()` to determine
 whether an object from this class stores a NaN value of any form.</p>

**Parameters:**

* <code>dbl</code> - The parameter <code>dbl</code> is a 64-bit floating-point number.

**Returns:**

* An arbitrary-precision decimal number with the same value as <code>
 dbl</code>.

### FromDoubleBits
    public static EDecimal FromDoubleBits(long dblBits)
Creates an arbitrary-precision decimal number from a 64-bit binary
 floating-point number, encoded in the IEEE 754 binary64 format. This method
 computes the exact value of the floating point number, not an approximation,
 as is often the case by converting the floating point number to a string
 first. Remember, though, that the exact value of a 64-bit binary
 floating-point number is not always the value that results when passing a
 literal decimal number, since not all decimal numbers can be converted to
 exact binary numbers (in the example given, the resulting
 arbitrary-precision decimal will be the value of the closest "double" to
 0.1, not 0.1 exactly). To create an arbitrary-precision decimal number from
 a decimal value, use FromString instead in most cases.

**Parameters:**

* <code>dblBits</code> - The parameter <code>dblBits</code> is a 64-bit signed integer.

**Returns:**

* An arbitrary-precision decimal number with the same value as <code>
 dblBits</code>.

### FromSingle
    public static EDecimal FromSingle(float flt)
<p>Creates an arbitrary-precision decimal number from a 32-bit binary
 floating-point number. This method computes the exact value of the floating
 point number, not an approximation, as is often the case by converting the
 floating point number to a string first. Remember, though, that the exact
 value of a 32-bit binary floating-point number is not always the value that
 results when passing a literal decimal number (for example, calling <code>
 EDecimal.FromSingle(0.1f)</code>), since not all decimal numbers can be converted
 to exact binary numbers (in the example given, the resulting
 arbitrary-precision decimal will be the the value of the closest "float" to
 0.1, not 0.1 exactly). To create an arbitrary-precision decimal number from
 a decimal value, use FromString instead in most cases (for example: <code>
 EDecimal.FromString("0.1")</code>). </p> <p>The input value can be a not-a-number
 (NaN) value (such as <code>Float.NaN</code> in DotNet or Float.NaN in Java);
 however, NaN values have multiple forms that are equivalent for many
 applications' purposes, and <code>Float.NaN</code> / <code>Float.NaN</code> is only
 one of these equivalent forms. In fact, <code>
 EDecimal.FromSingle(Float.NaN)</code> or <code>EDecimal.FromSingle(Float.NaN)</code>
 could produce an object that is represented differently between DotNet and
 Java, because <code>Float.NaN</code> / <code>Float.NaN</code> may have a different
 form in DotNet and Java (for example, the NaN value's sign may be negative
 in DotNet, but positive in Java). Use `IsNaN()` to determine whether an
 object from this class stores a NaN value of any form.</p>

**Parameters:**

* <code>flt</code> - The parameter <code>flt</code> is a 32-bit binary floating-point
 number.

**Returns:**

* An arbitrary-precision decimal number with the same value as <code>
 flt</code>.

### FromSingleBits
    public static EDecimal FromSingleBits(int value)
Creates an arbitrary-precision decimal number from a 32-bit binary
 floating-point number encoded in the IEEE 754 binary32 format. This method
 computes the exact value of the floating point number, not an approximation,
 as is often the case by converting the floating point number to a string
 first. Remember, though, that the exact value of a 32-bit binary
 floating-point number is not always the value that results when passing a
 literal decimal number, since not all decimal numbers can be converted to
 exact binary numbers (in the example given, the resulting
 arbitrary-precision decimal will be the the value of the closest "float" to
 0.1, not 0.1 exactly). To create an arbitrary-precision decimal number from
 a decimal value, use FromString instead in most cases.

**Parameters:**

* <code>value</code> - A 32-bit binary floating-point number encoded in the IEEE 754
 binary32 format.

**Returns:**

* An arbitrary-precision decimal number with the same value as <code>
 value</code>.

### FromHalfBits
    public static EDecimal FromHalfBits(short value)
Creates a decimal floating-point number from a binary floating-point number
 encoded in the IEEE 754 binary16 format (also known as a "half-precision"
 floating-point number). This method computes the exact value of the floating
 point number, not an approximation, as is often the case by converting the
 floating point number to a string first.

**Parameters:**

* <code>value</code> - A binary floating-point number encoded in the IEEE 754 binary16
 format.

**Returns:**

* A decimal floating-point number with the same floating-point value
 as <code>value</code>.

    public static EDecimal FromString(char[] chars)
Creates an arbitrary-precision decimal number from a sequence of <code>
 char</code> s that represents a number. See <code>FromString(string, int, int,

 an EContext is often much faster than creating the EDecimal then calling
 <code>RoundToPrecision</code> on that EDecimal, especially if the context
 specifies a precision limit and exponent range.

**Parameters:**

* <code>chars</code> - A sequence that represents a number.

**Returns:**

* An arbitrary-precision decimal number with the same value as the

 precision is unlimited and rounding isn't needed. Note that providing a
 context is often much faster than creating the EDecimal without a context
 then calling <code>RoundToPrecision</code> on that EDecimal, especially if the
 context specifies a precision limit and exponent range.

**Returns:**

* An arbitrary-precision decimal number with the same value as the
 given sequence of <code>char</code> s.

Creates an arbitrary-precision decimal number from a sequence of <code>
 char</code> s that represents a number. See <code>FromString(string, int, int,
 EContext)</code> for more information. Note that calling the overload that takes
 an EContext is often much faster than creating the EDecimal then calling
 <code>RoundToPrecision</code> on that EDecimal, especially if the context
 specifies a precision limit and exponent range.

**Parameters:**

* <code>chars</code> - A sequence that represents a number.

* <code>offset</code> - An index starting at 0 showing where the desired portion of

 HasFlags</code> is true and the integer part of the division result doesn't fit
 the precision and exponent range without rounding. Can be null, in which the

 down to an integer after division, is needed.
