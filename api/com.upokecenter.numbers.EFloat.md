# com.upokecenter.numbers.EFloat

    public final class EFloat extends Object implements Comparable<EFloat>

<p>Represents an arbitrary-precision binary floating-point number. (The "E"
 stands for "extended", meaning that instances of this class can be values
 other than numbers proper, such as infinity and not-a-number.) Each number
 consists of an integer significand and an integer exponent, both
 arbitrary-precision. The value of the number equals significand *
 2^exponent. This class also supports values for negative zero, not-a-number
 (NaN) values, and infinity. </p><p>Passing a signaling NaN to any arithmetic
 operation shown here will signal the flag FlagInvalid and return a quiet
 NaN, even if another operand to that operation is a quiet NaN, unless the
 operation's documentation expressly states that another result happens when
 a signaling NaN is passed to that operation.</p> <p>Passing a quiet NaN to
 any arithmetic operation shown here will return a quiet NaN, unless the
 operation's documentation expressly states that another result happens when
 a quiet NaN is passed to that operation.</p> <p>Unless noted otherwise,
 passing a null arbitrary-precision binary floating-point number argument to
 any method here will throw an exception.</p> <p>When an arithmetic operation
 signals the flag FlagInvalid, FlagOverflow, or FlagDivideByZero, it will not
 throw an exception too, unless the operation's trap is enabled in the
 arithmetic context (see EContext's Traps property).</p> <p>An
 arbitrary-precision binary floating-point number value can be serialized in
 one of the following ways:</p> <ul> <li>By calling the toString() method.
 However, not all strings can be converted back to an arbitrary-precision
 binary floating-point number without loss, especially if the string has a
 fractional part.</li><li>By calling the UnsignedMantissa, Exponent, and
 IsNegative properties, and calling the IsInfinity, IsQuietNaN, and
 IsSignalingNaN methods. The return values combined will uniquely identify a
 particular arbitrary-precision binary floating-point number value.</li></ul>
 <p>If an operation requires creating an intermediate value that might be too
 big to fit in memory (or might require more than 2 gigabytes of memory to
 store -- due to the current use of a 32-bit integer internally as a length),
 the operation may signal an invalid-operation flag and return not-a-number
 (NaN). In certain rare cases, the compareTo method may throw
 OutOfMemoryError (called OutOfMemoryError in Java) in the same
 circumstances.</p> <p><b>Thread safety</b></p> <p>Instances of this class
 are immutable, so they are inherently safe for use by multiple threads.
 Multiple instances of this object with the same properties are
 interchangeable, so they should not be compared using the "==" operator
 (which might only check if each side of the operator is the same
 instance).</p> <p><b>Comparison considerations</b></p> <p>This class's
 natural ordering (under the compareTo method) is not consistent with the
 Equals method. This means that two values that compare as equal under the
 compareTo method might not be equal under the Equals method. The compareTo
 method compares the mathematical values of the two instances passed to it
 (and considers two different NaN values as equal), while two instances with
 the same mathematical value, but different exponents, will be considered
 unequal under the Equals method.</p> <p><b>Security note</b></p> <p>It is
 not recommended to implement security-sensitive algorithms using the methods
 in this class, for several reasons:</p> <ul> <li> <code>EFloat</code> objects are
 immutable, so they can't be modified, and the memory they occupy is not
 guaranteed to be cleared in a timely fashion due to garbage collection. This
 is relevant for applications that use many-bit-long numbers as secret
 parameters.</li><li>The methods in this class (especially those that involve
 arithmetic) are not guaranteed to be "constant-time" (nondata-dependent) for
 all relevant inputs. Certain attacks that involve encrypted communications
 have exploited the timing and other aspects of such communications to derive
 keying material or cleartext indirectly.</li></ul> <p>Applications should
 instead use dedicated security libraries to handle big numbers in
 security-sensitive algorithms.</p> <p><b>Reproducibility note</b></p> <p>See
 the reproducibility note in the EDecimal class's documentation.</p>

 however, NaN values have multiple forms that are equivalent for many

<p>Creates a binary floating-point number from a 64-bit floating-point
 number. This method computes the exact value of the floating point number,
 not an approximation, as is often the case by converting the floating point
 number to a string first. </p> <p>The input value can be a not-a-number
 (NaN) value (such as <code>Double.NaN</code>); however, NaN values have multiple
 forms that are equivalent for many applications' purposes, and <code>
 Double.NaN</code> is only one of these equivalent forms. In fact, <code>
 EFloat.FromDouble(Double.NaN)</code> could produce an object that is represented
 differently between DotNet and Java, because <code>Double.NaN</code> may have a
 different form in DotNet and Java (for example, the NaN value's sign may be
 negative in DotNet, but positive in Java). Use `IsNaN()` to determine
 whether an object from this class stores a NaN value of any form.</p>

**Parameters:**

**Returns:**

* A binary floating-point number with the same value as <code>dbl</code>.

 a number. Note that if the string contains a negative exponent, the
 resulting value might not be exact, in which case the resulting binary
 floating-point number will be an approximation of this decimal number's

 <li>An optional plus sign ("+" , U+002B) or minus sign ("-", U+002D) (if '-'
 , the value is negative.)</li><li>One or more digits, with a single optional
 decimal point (".", U+002E) before or after those digits or between two of
 them. These digits may begin with any number of zeros.</li><li>Optionally,
 "E+"/"e+" (positive exponent) or "E-"/"e-" (negative exponent) plus one or
 more digits specifying the exponent (these digits may begin with any number
 of zeros).</li></ul> <p>The string can also be "-INF", "-Infinity",
 "Infinity", "INF", quiet NaN ("NaN") followed by any number of digits (these
 digits may begin with any number of zeros), or signaling NaN ("sNaN")
 followed by any number of digits (these digits may begin with any number of
 zeros), all where the letters can be any combination of basic uppercase and
 basic lowercase letters.</p> <p>All characters mentioned earlier are the
 corresponding characters in the Basic Latin range. In particular, the digits
 must be the basic digits 0 to 9 (U+0030 to U+0039). The string is not
 allowed to contain white space characters, including spaces.</p>

 floating-point number by another arbitrary-precision binary floating-point
 number. Returns infinity if the divisor (this arbitrary-precision binary

 on the maximum precision. If rounding to a number of binary digit places is
 desired, it's better to use the RoundToExponent and RoundToIntegral methods
 instead.</p> <p><b>Remark:</b> This method can be used to implement
 fixed-point binary arithmetic, in which each binary floating-point number
 has a fixed number of digits after the radix point. The following code
 example returns a fixed-point number with up to 20 digits before and exactly

 HalfEven.

**Returns:**

* A binary floating-point number with the same value as this object
 but with the exponent changed. Signals FlagInvalid and returns not-a-number

### Quantize

 binary arithmetic in which no digits come after the radix point (a desired
 exponent of 0) is considered an "integer arithmetic".</p>

**Parameters:**

* <code>desiredExponentInt</code> - The desired exponent for the result. The exponent
 is the number of fractional digits in the result, expressed as a negative

 means round to the thousand (10^3, 1000). A value of 0 rounds the number to
 an integer.

**Throws:**

* <code>ArithmeticException</code> - This value is infinity or not-a-number, or the
 number, once converted to an integer by discarding its fractional part, is
 less than -9223372036854775808 or greater than 9223372036854775807.

### ToInt64Unchecked
    public long ToInt64Unchecked()
Converts this number's value to an integer by discarding its fractional
 part, and returns the least-significant bits of its two's-complement form as
 a 64-bit signed integer.

**Returns:**

* This number, converted to a 64-bit signed integer. Returns 0 if this
 value is infinity or not-a-number.

### ToInt64IfExact
    public long ToInt64IfExact()
Converts this number's value to a 64-bit signed integer if it can fit in a
 64-bit signed integer without rounding to a different numerical value.

**Returns:**

* This number's value as a 64-bit signed integer.

**Throws:**

* <code>ArithmeticException</code> - This value is infinity or not-a-number, is not
 an exact integer, or is less than -9223372036854775808 or greater than
 9223372036854775807.

### FromInt64AsUnsigned
    public static EFloat FromInt64AsUnsigned(long longerValue)
Converts an unsigned integer expressed as a 64-bit signed integer to an
 arbitrary-precision binary number.

**Parameters:**

* <code>longerValue</code> - A 64-bit signed integer. If this value is 0 or greater,
 the return value will represent it. If this value is less than 0, the return
 value will store 2^64 plus this value instead.

**Returns:**

* An arbitrary-precision binary number with the exponent set to 0. If
 <code>longerValue</code> is 0 or greater, the return value will represent it. If
 <code>longerValue</code> is less than 0, the return value will store 2^64 plus
 this value instead.

### FromInt64
    public static EFloat FromInt64(long inputInt64)
Converts a 64-bit signed integer to an arbitrary-precision binary
 floating-point number.

**Parameters:**

* <code>inputInt64</code> - The number to convert as a 64-bit signed integer.

**Returns:**

* This number's value as an arbitrary-precision binary floating-point
 number with the exponent set to 0.
